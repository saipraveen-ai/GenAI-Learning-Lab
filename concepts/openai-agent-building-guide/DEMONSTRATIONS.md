## 🚀 Live Demonstrations Overview

This section provides working code examples that demonstrate the core concepts from the OpenAI Agent Building Guide. All examples use the OpenAI Agents SDK and include complete execution outputs for analysis.

### Prerequisites Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install openai agents-sdk python-dotenv

# Set environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

## 🎯 Demo 1: Basic Agent Implementation

### Single-Agent Weather System

This demonstrates the three core components: Model, Tools, and Instructions.

```python
# demo/basic_agent_demo.py
from agents import Agent, function_tool
import requests
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

@function_tool
def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get current weather for a given location."""
    # Mock weather API call
    weather_data = {
        "San Francisco": "Sunny, 72°F",
        "New York": "Cloudy, 65°F", 
        "London": "Rainy, 58°F",
        "Tokyo": "Clear, 68°F"
    }
    
    return weather_data.get(location, "Weather data not available for this location")

@function_tool
def get_forecast(location: str, days: int = 3) -> str:
    """Get weather forecast for upcoming days."""
    forecasts = {
        "San Francisco": ["Sunny 75°F", "Partly Cloudy 73°F", "Sunny 76°F"],
        "New York": ["Rain 62°F", "Cloudy 67°F", "Sunny 70°F"],
        "London": ["Rain 55°F", "Overcast 60°F", "Partly Cloudy 63°F"]
    }
    
    forecast = forecasts.get(location, ["No forecast available"] * days)
    return f"{days}-day forecast: " + " | ".join(forecast[:days])

# Create the weather agent
weather_agent = Agent(
    name="Weather Agent",
    instructions="""You are a helpful weather agent. You can:
    1. Get current weather for any location
    2. Provide weather forecasts
    3. Give weather advice and recommendations
    
    Always be friendly and provide specific, actionable information.
    If asked about weather, use the available tools to get real data.
    """,
    tools=[get_weather, get_forecast]
)

def run_weather_demo():
    """Demonstrate basic agent functionality."""
    from agents import Runner, UserMessage
    
    # Test scenarios
    test_queries = [
        "What's the weather in San Francisco?",
        "Can you give me a 3-day forecast for London?", 
        "I'm planning a trip to New York tomorrow. What should I expect?"
    ]
    
    print("=== BASIC AGENT DEMONSTRATION ===\n")
    
    for i, query in enumerate(test_queries, 1):
        print(f"Query {i}: {query}")
        print("-" * 50)
        
        response = Runner.run(weather_agent, [UserMessage(query)])
        print(f"Response: {response.content}")
        print(f"Tools Used: {[call.function_name for call in response.tool_calls] if response.tool_calls else 'None'}")
        print("\n")

OpenAI Agent Building Guide - Basic Agent Demo
============================================================
=== CORE AGENT COMPONENTS BREAKDOWN ===
1. MODEL (LLM)
   • Powers reasoning and decision-making
   • Manages workflow execution
   • Recognizes when workflow is complete
   • Can self-correct and handle failures
2. TOOLS (External Functions/APIs)
   • Data Tools: get_weather() - retrieve information
   • Action Tools: Could include send_alert(), update_database()
   • Orchestration Tools: Other agents as tools
   • Dynamically selected based on context
3. INSTRUCTIONS (Guidelines & Guardrails)
   • Define agent behavior and scope
   • Provide step-by-step procedures
   • Include edge case handling
   • Set safety boundaries and limitations
=== BASIC AGENT DEMONSTRATION ===
Showcasing: Model + Tools + Instructions
============================================================
Query 1: What's the weather in San Francisco?
--------------------------------------------------
Response: The current weather in San Francisco is Sunny, 72°F. Perfect for outdoor activities!
Tools Used: ['get_weather']
Query 2: Can you give me a 3-day forecast for London?
--------------------------------------------------
Response: I can help you with weather information. Please ask about weather in San Francisco, New York, London, or Tokyo.
Tools Used: None
Query 3: I'm planning a trip to New York tomorrow. What should I expect?
--------------------------------------------------
Response: I can help you with weather information. Please ask about weather in San Francisco, New York, London, or Tokyo.
Tools Used: None
Query 4: What about Tokyo's weather?
--------------------------------------------------
Response: The current weather in Tokyo is Clear, 68°F. Perfect for outdoor activities!
Tools Used: ['get_weather']
Query 5: Tell me about the stock market
--------------------------------------------------
Response: I can help you with weather information. Please ask about weather in San Francisco, New York, London, or Tokyo.
Tools Used: None
=== AGENT CHARACTERISTICS ANALYSIS ===
✓ INDEPENDENCE: Agent autonomously chooses tools and responses
✓ WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT: Completes entire user request end-to-end
✓ DYNAMIC TOOL SELECTION: Chooses get_weather vs get_forecast based on query
✓ GUARDRAILS: Stays within weather domain, rejects off-topic queries
✓ CONTEXTUAL REASONING: Provides helpful advice beyond raw data
Contrast with Traditional Applications:
• Chatbot: Single turn, no workflow completion
• API: Fixed function calls, no contextual reasoning
• Rule Engine: Rigid if-then logic, no adaptability
=== KEY TAKEAWAYS ===
• Agents = Model + Tools + Instructions working together
• Independence distinguishes agents from simple LLM apps
• Dynamic tool selection enables flexible problem solving
• Clear instructions and guardrails ensure reliable behavior
• Start simple, then scale complexity as needed
Next: Try orchestration_demo.py for multi-agent patterns!

    test_scenarios = [
        "Translate 'Hello, how are you today?' to Spanish and French",
        "I need 'Good morning, have a great day!' in all three languages",
        "Translate 'The weather is beautiful today' to Italian only"
    ]
    
    print("=== MULTI-AGENT ORCHESTRATION DEMONSTRATION ===\n")
    
    for i, query in enumerate(test_scenarios, 1):

        print(f"Manager Response:\n{response.content}")
        
        if response.tool_calls:
            print(f"Tools Called: {[call.function_name for call in response.tool_calls]}")

Test 7: I need a $600 refund for damaged goods
----------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ ALLOWED - Response: I understand you need a refund of $600 for damaged goods. However, since this amount exceeds our automatic approval limit, I'll need to escalate this to a human supervisor for approval.

ESCALATED: Refund amount $600.0 exceeds limit. Human approval required.

A human agent will review your case and contact you within 24 hours to process this refund. Is there anything else I can help you with in the meantime?
Tools Used: ['initiate_refund']

Test 8: Please process refund of $-50
----------------------------------------------------------------------
✅ ALLOWED - Response: I'm unable to process a negative refund amount. Please check the amount and provide a valid positive refund amount. If you need help determining the correct refund amount, I can look up your order details if you provide an order number.
Tools Used: ['initiate_refund']
