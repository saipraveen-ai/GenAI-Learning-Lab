## 🚀 Live Demonstrations Overview

This section provides working code examples that demonstrate the core concepts from the OpenAI Agent Building Guide. All examples use the OpenAI Agents SDK and include complete execution outputs for analysis.

### Prerequisites Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install openai agents-sdk python-dotenv

# Set environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

## 🎯 Demo 1: Basic Agent Implementation

### Single-Agent Weather System

This demonstrates the three core components: Model, Tools, and Instructions.

```python
# demo/basic_agent_demo.py
from agents import Agent, function_tool
import requests
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

@function_tool
def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get current weather for a given location."""
    # Mock weather API call
    weather_data = {
        "San Francisco": "Sunny, 72°F",
        "New York": "Cloudy, 65°F", 
        "London": "Rainy, 58°F",
        "Tokyo": "Clear, 68°F"
    }
    
    return weather_data.get(location, "Weather data not available for this location")

@function_tool
def get_forecast(location: str, days: int = 3) -> str:
    """Get weather forecast for upcoming days."""
    forecasts = {
        "San Francisco": ["Sunny 75°F", "Partly Cloudy 73°F", "Sunny 76°F"],
        "New York": ["Rain 62°F", "Cloudy 67°F", "Sunny 70°F"],
        "London": ["Rain 55°F", "Overcast 60°F", "Partly Cloudy 63°F"]
    }
    
    forecast = forecasts.get(location, ["No forecast available"] * days)
    return f"{days}-day forecast: " + " | ".join(forecast[:days])

# Create the weather agent
weather_agent = Agent(
    name="Weather Agent",
    instructions="""You are a helpful weather agent. You can:
    1. Get current weather for any location
    2. Provide weather forecasts
    3. Give weather advice and recommendations

    If asked about weather, use the available tools to get real data.
    """,
    tools=[get_weather, get_forecast]
)

def run_weather_demo():
    """Demonstrate basic agent functionality."""
    from agents import Runner, UserMessage
    
    # Test scenarios
    test_queries = [
        "What's the weather in San Francisco?",
        "Can you give me a 3-day forecast for London?", 
        "I'm planning a trip to New York tomorrow. What should I expect?"
    ]
    
    print("=== BASIC AGENT DEMONSTRATION ===\n")
    
    for i, query in enumerate(test_queries, 1):
        print(f"Query {i}: {query}")
        print("-" * 50)
        
        response = Runner.run(weather_agent, [UserMessage(query)])
        print(f"Response: {response.content}")
        print(f"Tools Used: {[call.function_name for call in response.tool_calls] if response.tool_calls else 'None'}")
        print("\n")
