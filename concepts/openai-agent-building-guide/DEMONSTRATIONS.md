```python
# demo/basic_agent_demo.py
from agents import Agent, function_tool
import requests
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

@function_tool
def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get current weather for a given location."""
    # Mock weather API call
    weather_data = {
        "San Francisco": "Sunny, 72°F",
        "New York": "Cloudy, 65°F", 
        "London": "Rainy, 58°F",
        "Tokyo": "Clear, 68°F"
    }
    
    return weather_data.get(location, "Weather data not available for this location")

@function_tool
def get_forecast(location: str, days: int = 3) -> str:
    """Get weather forecast for upcoming days."""
    forecasts = {
        "San Francisco": ["Sunny 75°F", "Partly Cloudy 73°F", "Sunny 76°F"],
        "New York": ["Rain 62°F", "Cloudy 67°F", "Sunny 70°F"],
        "London": ["Rain 55°F", "Overcast 60°F", "Partly Cloudy 63°F"]
    }
    
    forecast = forecasts.get(location, ["No forecast available"] * days)
    return f"{days}-day forecast: " + " | ".join(forecast[:days])

# Create the weather agent
weather_agent = Agent(
    name="Weather Agent",
    instructions="""You are a helpful weather agent. You can:
    1. Get current weather for any location
    2. Provide weather forecasts

Successful remote team collaboration requires intentional structure, appropriate technology, and consistent communication practices. Organizations implementing these best practices report 73% higher productivity compared to ad-hoc remote work approaches.

## Communication Excellence
Establish multi-channel communication frameworks that serve different purposes: instant messaging for immediate questions, scheduled video conferences for complex discussions, and asynchronous project management tools for task coordination. Clear communication protocols prevent misunderstandings and ensure information flows efficiently across time zones.

## Relationship Building and Culture
Regular video interactions are essential for maintaining team cohesion and company culture. Implement weekly all-hands meetings, monthly one-on-one check-ins, and quarterly virtual team-building activities. These touchpoints prevent isolation and maintain the personal connections that drive collaborative success.

## Technology Infrastructure and Training
Invest in enterprise-grade collaboration platforms including video conferencing, cloud-based document sharing, and integrated project management systems. Equally important is comprehensive training to ensure all team members can leverage these tools effectively. Technology adoption requires both the right tools and the skills to use them.

**Implementation Roadmap**: Start with communication protocols, implement technology solutions gradually, and continuously gather feedback to refine your remote collaboration approach.

## 📝 Demo Execution Notes

### Understanding Output Variations

**🌊 Real-Time Data Integration Demo**: 
- Generates **live streaming data** with random stock prices, timestamps, and market events
- Each execution produces completely different output simulating real market conditions
- Volume surges, price movements, and alerts are dynamically generated
- This demonstrates how real-time systems handle unpredictable data streams

**🔧 Dynamic Tool Discovery Demo**:
- Uses **mock implementations** with consistent core workflow
- Timestamps and simulation timings may vary slightly between runs
- API discovery results and tool generation outputs remain consistent
- This showcases the systematic approach to dynamic tool creation

**Other Demos**:
- Most other demos produce **consistent output** as they use fixed scenarios
- Any variations are typically limited to timestamps or minor simulation details

To see live variations in action, run the demos multiple times:
```bash
python demo/realtime_data_demo.py    # Always different output
python demo/dynamic_tools_demo.py    # Consistent workflow, variable timings
```
