"""
Rule-Based Thermostat System

A simple thermostat that follows fixed rules with no memory or learning.
This represents traditional programming approaches.

Key Characteristics:
- Fixed rules that never change
- No memory of past temperatures
- Deterministic: same input always produces same output
- Simple and predictable behavior
