Agent-Based Thermostat System

An intelligent thermostat that learns, remembers, and adapts its behavior.
This represents agent-based system approaches with memory and learning.

Key Characteristics:
- Has memory of past temperatures and actions
- Learns from patterns and adapts preferences
- Context-aware decision making
- Evolves behavior over time
