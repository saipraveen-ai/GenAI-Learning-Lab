# Adaptation vs Rules Decision Tree

This flowchart provides a practical decision tree for choosing the right system type (Rule-Based, AI Agent, or Agentic AI) based on your specific use case requirements.

## Decision Points

### 🎯 Static Requirements?
**Key Question**: Do you always have the same inputs and outputs?
- **Yes → Rule-Based System**: Perfect for predictable, fixed workflows
- **No → Continue**: Variable requirements need more intelligence

### 📚 Need Learning?
**Key Question**: Should the system adapt to patterns over time?
- **Basic improvements → Smart Rule-Based**: Business logic with analytics
- **Pattern adaptation → Continue**: True learning capability needed

### 🧠 Context Awareness?
**Key Question**: Does the system need multi-factor decision making?
- **Simple, single domain → AI Agent**: Pattern recognition within one area
- **Complex, multi-system → Continue**: Cross-domain coordination needed

### 🔄 Multiple Systems?
**Key Question**: Do multiple systems need to coordinate?
- **Yes → Agentic AI System**: Multi-agent orchestration required
- **No → AI Agent**: Independent operation sufficient

## System Characteristics

### 📋 Rule-Based System
- ✅ **Strengths**: Predictable, fast, easy to debug
- ❌ **Limitations**: No adaptation, manual updates required
- **Examples**: Email filtering, basic automation, simple notifications

### 🔧 Smart Rule-Based System
- ✅ **Strengths**: Business logic + analytics, conditional processing
- ⚠️ **Limitations**: Limited learning, manual updates
- **Examples**: Business processes, approval workflows, data validation

### 🤖 AI Agent
- ✅ **Strengths**: Pattern recognition, learning, context awareness
- ⚠️ **Limitations**: Single domain focus
- **Examples**: Chatbots, recommendation systems, smart thermostats

### 🚀 Agentic AI System
- ✅ **Strengths**: Multi-agent coordination, strategic planning, emergent intelligence
- **Examples**: Building management, enterprise automation, multi-domain coordination
