# Requirements for Agentic AI vs AI Agents Concept
# Only dependencies actually used in the experiments

# The experiments only use Python standard library modules:
# - datetime, re, json, random, math
# - typing, dataclasses, enum
# - All built into Python 3.10+

# No external dependencies are currently needed!
# This file serves as a placeholder for future experiments that might need:

# Future ML/AI experiments (commented out until needed):
# numpy>=1.24.0
# scikit-learn>=1.3.0
# matplotlib>=3.7.0

# Development tools (optional):
# pytest>=7.4.0
# black>=23.0.0

# Note: All current experiments run with just Python standard library
